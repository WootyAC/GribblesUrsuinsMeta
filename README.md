This meta will navigate your character to the Gribble's Ursuins area, flag with the NPC, and begin killing the Ursuins for the kill task.

Using The Meta

Install the meta by moving the Ursuins_Wooty.met and UrsuinsHunting.nav file to your Virindi Tank directory

Don't bother running your character to the Ursuins Hunting area before you start, it will navigate you there on its own

Make sure your character isn't "busy" (fighting monsters etc) when you start the meta

The meta will flag you, and turn in the KTs to the NPC when complete

Avoid starting the meta if you are close to your luminance cap so you don't waste any luminance

Client Control 

The meta now supports starting the meta on all the other AC characters running on the same machine with the click of a button. When you start the meta, a Vtank Meta View with a "Start On All Clients" button will appear. Clicking the button will send the command to all of your other characters to start the meta.
