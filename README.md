This meta will navigate your character to the Gribble's Ursuins area, flag with the NPC, and begin killing the Ursuins for the kill task.

Using The Meta

Install the meta by moving the Ursuins_Wooty.met and UrsuinsHunting.nav file to your Virindi Tank directory

Don't bother running your character to the Ursuins Hunting area before you start, it will navigate you there on its own

Make sure your character isn't "busy" (fighting monsters etc) when you start the meta

The meta will flag you, and turn in the KTs to the NPC when complete

Avoid starting the meta if you are close to your luminance cap so you don't waste any luminance
